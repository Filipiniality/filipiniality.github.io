            <h2>Another - Paul Tremblay</h2>
            <img src="./pictures/another_tremblay.jpg" alt="Cover of Paul Tremblay's Another">
            <h3>The Good:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Did not realize it was aimed at middle schoolers until page 100.</li>
                <li>Extremely creepy handdrawn images.</li>
                <li>Even creepier descriptions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Bad:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has big "how do you do, fellow kids?" energy.</li>
                <li>No subtely, presumable because the author doesn't trust little kids to get his subtext.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I had planned on re-reading <cite>Horror Movie</cite> by the same author, but I saw that this was
                released since then. I downloaded it from a piracy website so I didn't know I was way older than the
                target demographic.</p>

            <h2>3D Workers Island</h2>
            <img src="./pictures/3dwiscr.jpg" alt="A page from Tony Domenico's 3D Workers Island">
            <h3>The Good:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Extremely creative premise.</li>
                <li>Visuals are accurate to 90s internet and Windows95.</li>
                <li>A lot of rereadability.</li>
                <li>Has disturbing content without being shlocky.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Bad:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lowkey requires you to read another story from the same author.</li>
                <li>If I gave content warnings it would spoil the entire story.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I don't follow the author on any website so I found out about this long after it was uploaded online.</p>
