This provides a higher level of protection than packet filtering, because it makes access decisions based on the steps that have already been completed in the dialog.";}

{document.getElementById("q3").innerHTML = "<b>Correct.</b> While the other procedures listed are reasonable, proper, and within the company’s purview, it simply may not be possible—or even reasonable—to collect from the employee all devices which are known to contain company data. Particularly in a bring your own device \(BYOD\) environment, it is almost certain that the employee’s personal mobile device contains corporate data, and such devices most likely will not be surrendered willingly. It may be possible for the company to remotely wipe some mobile devices, but only if the employee consented in advance to such measures as part of a signed employment agreement."}

function q4_correct()
{document.getElementById("q4").innerHTML = "<b>Correct.</b> The key distinction between Direct Access and Sequential Access storage devices is that any point on a Direct Access Storage Device may be promptly reached, whereas every point in between the current position and the desired position of a Sequential Access Storage Device must be traversed in order to reach the desired position. Tape drives are Sequential Access Storage Devices. Some tape drives have minimal amounts of Direct Access intelligence built in. These include multitrack tape devices that store at specific points on the tape and cache in the tape drive information about where major sections of data on the tape begin, allowing the tape drive to more quickly reach a track and a point on the track from which to begin the now much shorter traversal of data from that indexed point to the desired point. While this makes such tape drives noticeably faster than their purely sequential peers, the difference in performance between Sequential and Direct Access Storage Devices is orders of magnitude.";}

Biometric systems that base authentication decisions on physical attributes (iris, retina, fingerprint\) provide more accuracy, because they do not change as often and are harder to impersonate";}

Clusters work as an intelligent unit to balance traffic, and users who access the cluster do not know they may be accessing different systems at different times. To the users, all servers within the cluster are seen as one unit.";}

function q15_correct()
{document.getElementById("q15").innerHTML = "<b>Correct.</b> The primary reason modern security assessments still must evaluate exposure to war dialing is that many organizations still employ modems for backup communications yet don’t secure them well because of the common misunderstanding that the vulnerability of an exposed modem is no longer a worry. Although the modern war dialing tools available do contribute to this concern, they are ineffective against a properly secured modem.";}

The reader and card communicate directly. The card and reader has a receiver, transmitter, and battery. The reader sends signals to the card to request information. The card sends the reader an access code.";}
